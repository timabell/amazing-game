Dev Environment

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* MonoDevelop
* exuberant-ctags
* monodevelop-nunit (NUnit plugin for MonoDevelop)
* Git (obviously, why would you use anything else? :-D )

About
-----

Some might say, this is a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> with its turtle but I say it's muuuuuuch better :-D

WishList
--------
* I couldn't use [NuGet for MonoDevelop](http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2013/01/07/MonoDevelopNuGetAddin.aspx) as my MonoDevelop is too old (v2) boo. That's what you get for running a stable distro.
